# Deck Megathread Parser

A small utility i've created for the /r/SteamDeck subreddit for easier parsing and tracking of people's reserve times

You can find the latest compiled version for windows [here](https://github.com/themorfeus/Deck-Megathread-Parser/releases)


To use, you must create and set-up a reddit app [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and create a file called **config.ini** next to the executable, with the following contents:

```
AppID=YOUR_APP_ID
AppSecret=YOUR_APP_SECRET
```

When the app asks you for the post ID you must paste the ID that you can find in the post link - right after the `comments` section. 

Presented below in bold:

[...]r/SteamDeck/comments/**udz36r**/order_email_mega[...]


Then just input your region and the size you're looking for (the app uses these as keywords, so input only from the available options please.)

have fun!
