# Deck Megathread Parser

A small utility i've created for the /r/SteamDeck subreddit for easier parsing and tracking of people's reserve times

To use, you must create and set-up a reddit app [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and insert your secret and app id into DeckFetcher.cs
When the app asks you for the post ID you must paste the ID that you can find in the post link - right after the `comments` section. 

Presented below in bold:

[...]r/SteamDeck/comments/**udz36r**/order_email_mega[...]


Then just input your region and the size you're looking for (the app uses these as keywords, so input only from the available options please.)

have fun!
